I am a 5th year PhD student in the Organizational Behavior group at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University.

My research focuses on decision making, negotiation, and the ways that individuals stray from the strategies that would create the most value for their organizations and themselves.

As an academic, I believe strongly in the importance of open methodology.  As an author of analysis code, I believe strongly in the importance of good version control.  For these reasons I attempt to share publicly the full content of the data and analysis from my research projects.

Studies are identified by 3 or 4 letter codes.  The following index should explain what the codes correspond to.
